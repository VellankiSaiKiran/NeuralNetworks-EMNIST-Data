# EMNIST Neural Networks Project

## Overview
This project focuses on applying neural networks to recognize handwritten characters from the EMNIST dataset. It involves preprocessing the dataset, building neural network models, training these models on the data, and evaluating their performance to identify the most effective architectures for handwritten character recognition.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques to prepare the EMNIST dataset for training, including normalization and reshaping.
- **Model Building:** Construction of neural network models using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Training:** Procedures for training models on the EMNIST dataset with various hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation:** Methods for assessing model performance on test data.

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3.8 or later. The main libraries used are:
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the .ipynb file)
